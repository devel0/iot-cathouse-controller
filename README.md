### thirdy part libraries

- [ArduinoJsonWriter](https://github.com/maxpowel/ArduinoJsonWriter)
- [JsonStreamingParser](https://github.com/squix78/json-streaming-parser)
- [StringStream](https://gist.github.com/arcao/3252bb6e5e52493f03726ec32e61395c)

## initial setup

### set wifi ssid and pwd

connect to serial interface of esp8266 through usb cable with minicom at 115200 8N1 and issue `ctrl+c` to stop unsuccesful initial wifi connection then press `?` for SerialOS commands
- `set wifi ssid <ssid>` to set your own wifi ssid
- `set wifi pwd <pwd>` to set your own wifi pwd
- data save automatically into eeprom
- `reconnect` to test new wifi parameters
- check in the serial log which ip assigned to your device ( a better approach is to reserve a fixed wellknown ip address in your network by mapping it from the interface mac address also printed in serial log )

### parameter configurations

- connect to `http://cathouseip` and go to Config page

### set temperature sensor ids

in order to allow the system recognition of temperature sensor for bottom, wood, ambient and extern first there is the need to write down their ids ; use one of existing inet [articles](https://www.google.com/search?q=arduino+ds18b20+id) to find out.
write correspondent temperature IDs in fields ( 16 hex char foreach device )

## debug

```
cd cathouse-controller
code .
```

- to build or check compilation `CTRL+SHIFT+R`
- to upload through USB-serial `CTRL+SHIFT+U`
